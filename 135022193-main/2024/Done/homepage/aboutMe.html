          <b>I am a 21 year old, (currently) self taught programmer from The Netherlands trying to find a career in software.</b>
        </h6>
        <p id="aboutP">
          When I was 18 I graduated from Business Administrator and found a job in the field pretty fast. <br>
          However after a few months I already started noticing how I never felt fullfilled in my job and<br> I very quickly got to a point where learning every day just wasnt possible
          and my favorite thing to do is learn.<br><br>

          So I made the decision to quit and to go look for something that would make me happy. <br>
          I very quickly found an interest in programming, but with no clue what i was gonna do i decided <br>to just start and see where it would lead me.
          For the first year or so of my programming journey <br>I wasnt making much progress, it felt very difficult to learn and super overwhelming. <br><br>

          Feeling overwhelmed combined with the confusion of not being sure what my future would <br>look like it wasnt easy but I never gave up and kept trying.
          Eventually i found CS50, <br>the free Havard computer science crash course and realised i didnt just like the idea of programming, <br>i loved programming.
          It gave me a constant challenge to overcome and endless new things to learn <br>and the amazing feeling of finally fixing that problem has still not gone away.<br><br>

          Now finally about 2 years in, I signed up to a pretty special school in Amsterdam called Codam, <br>a 42 school to be exact.
          I still have to get through the 4 week Piscine(bootcamp) to get in, <br>but i have never wanted anything more in my life and i'll be sure to give it my all. <br>

          <p>This picture was taken in Fanal Forest in Madeira.
            Normally this forest (Which is 1300 meters high up a mountain),
            is covered with mist from the clouds.<br> But when i was there
            it was actually very clear and it was a great experience
