        <div id="discountChecker">
          <h3>Discount Checker</h3>
          <p>Discount Checker is a website ive wanted to make for quite a while now (and it will be my final project for CS50).<br>
          It is a website where you can put in the link of a product from a popular webshop.<br>
          The website will then show the original price of the product and (if on discount) the discounted price of the product.<br>
          My plan is to make it give you notifications when something is on discount and keep track of prices to check for an all time low.</p>

          <p>The reason i want to make this website is ofcourse to learn more about web development<br>
          but also because i have wanted a website or app like this for a while, so i'll make it myself.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="ERblink">
          <h3>The Elden Ring Project</h3>
          <p>Now for a more hobby oriented and fun focused one. The Elden Ring Project I have worked on for a bit.<br>
            This project has no real use outside of it being fun.<br>
            For a while now I have seen peopple complete the videogame Elden Ring in bizarre ways with weird controllers<br>
            and I have always wanted to make one of those myself, so I came up with the blink to roll concept.<br>
            The basic concept is a blink detector that will send a signal to roll to the game when you blink,<br>
            this way the game will have be played by blinking instead of just pressing the button.
          </p>
          <p>I have gotten pretty far with the project so far, I got the blink detection and managed to make it roll when I blink.<br>
          But its not optimised and if i try to connect it to a virtual controller it crashes. So my plan is to put the project on pause for now<br>
          and learn more about Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's. The reason for this is that I believe i can run the blink detection through a Raspberry Pi<br>
          which will take the load of that off of my computer, which will then be able to smoothly run everything.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="customController">
          <h3>Custom Controller</h3>
          <p>The custom controller project comes from the Elden Ring project.<br>
            I realised how difficult it is to make custom programs for a controller and actually implement it.<br>
            I've always loved using controllers to play games but they all have their pros and cons<br>
            and the biggest con I have noticed recently is the inability to program them.</p>

          <p>So for this project I will make my own custom controller! This wont be a project i do anytime soon<br>
          since I still have alot to learn until i can start on it, but I do know It's possible.<br>
          My idea as of now is to use technology similar to the Arduino and the Raspberri Pi.<br>
          Since i currently have no experience with either of them im assuming this plan is going to change alot,<br>
          But the main idea of the project is to make a custom programmable controller.</p>
